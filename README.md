INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

This project provides two installation options:

1. Requirements.txt → For regular Python environments using pip.
2. Requirements.yml → For Conda environments.

USING Requirements.txt (pip)
-----------------------------
1. Open a terminal in the folder containing Requirements.txt.
2. Run:
pip install -r Requirements.txt

USING Requirements.yml (Conda)
------------------------------
1. Open a terminal in the folder containing Requirements.yml.
2. Run:
conda env create -f Requirements.yml
3. Activate the environment:
conda activate myenv

NOTES
-----
- Use Requirements.txt if you already have a Python environment set up.
- Use Requirements.yml if you want a separate Conda environment with a specific Python version.
